# Target: Blank Orchard module Readme



## Project Description

If enabled, outgoing links open in new window (just like with the deprecated `target="_blank"` attribute)


## Documentation

### Usage

Install and enable the module if you want to have outgoing links open in new windows.
If you want a link to exclude from this rule, use the "no-target-blank" class on it.

You can download the module from the [Orchard Gallery](http://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Piedone.TargetBlank).

### See the [Version history](Docs/VersionHistory.md)
